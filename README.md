# üë©‚Äçüíª A Slave to the Algorithms: How revealing can ones listening habits become

## Introduction
Hello, I'm Baran √ñzcan, and welcome to the README file for the Term Project of my Data Science course! üïπ

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to delve into my Spotify listening habits and leverage machine learning algorithms to predict my behavior based on my mood. By analyzing various song properties and the time during which I listen to them, I've developed a model that predicts whether I'll enjoy a particular song. Throughout this process, I've discovered fascinating insights into my listening habits, offering a unique perspective on the data.

## Project Highlights
While I can't divulge every detail(in order not to waste your time with unimportant things), I'll share some inspiring aspects of my findings. To complement this README, I'll provide a PowerPoint presentation detailing my discoveries, a brief (8-minute but i advise listening on 1.5 speed so 5 minutes) video explaining the presentation(recommended for a comprehensive understanding of the graphics) and giving some insights into my thought process.

//remark : The video exceeds the limit, but you can play it on 1.5 and i will take responsibility of the parts that are not understandable.

## Presentation Overview
The PowerPoint presentation will walk you through the project steps, but here's a quick overview:

### Steps:
#### 1. Get Inspired by a Problem, Devise a Hypothesis
#### 2. Collect Necessary Data
#### 3. Explore the Data (EDA)
#### 4. Build Relevant Models
#### 5. Assessment of the Hypotheses, Conclusion
